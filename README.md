# Kim Nguyen - @kimyvgy

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm Kim - a senior fullstack software engineer at Sun*. I play with a primary role in designing, developing, and advising on technical solutions within the [Viblo](https://about.viblo.asia) ecosystem. My day to day is writing Laravel, TypeScript, Go and Rust. Additionally, I have experience in deploying, managing, and operating systems within Kubernetes.

Beyond my professional roles, I'm a passionate open-source contributor and content creator. I actively participate in open-source projects on GitHub, leveraging my skills and knowledge to give back to the tech community.

I also enjoy sharing my technical insights through stories on Viblo. Currently, I'm creating [@PheLab](https://phelab.com), where I share knowledge through video content on my [YouTube](https://l.phelab.com/youtube) and [TikTok](https://l.phelab.com/tiktok) channel.
